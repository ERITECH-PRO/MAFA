    "Food processing represents a major lever for economic development and food security across Africa. MAFA is committed to this path by developing processing units that add value to local products and create economic opportunities. Our approach prioritizes short supply chains, reducing post-harvest losses and strengthening food autonomy in the territories where we operate.",
    "Our processing facilities transform local raw materials including cereals, legumes, fruits, and vegetables into ready-to-consume or distributable food products. We apply strict quality standards, ensuring food safety and complete product traceability. This activity generates local employment, stimulates agricultural economies, and contributes to reducing dependence on food imports.",
    "The impact of our agro-processing activity extends beyond economics. By supporting local producers and developing sustainable supply chains, MAFA actively contributes to strengthening food security. Our processed products also supply our own catering services, creating a virtuous synergy between our different activity sectors. This integrated approach demonstrates our commitment to sustainable and responsible development."
